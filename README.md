# Telecommunications-Company-Analyst-Prediction-project
A telecommunications company is concerned about the number of customers leaving their land-line business for cable competitors. They need to understand who is leaving. Imagine that you are an analyst at this company and you have to find out who is leaving and why.


About the Dataset:
We will use a telecommunications dataset for predicting customer churn. This is a historical customer dataset where each row represents one customer. The data is relatively easy to understand, and you may uncover insights you can use immediately. Typically it is less expensive to keep customers than acquire new ones, so the focus of this analysis is to predict the customers who will stay with the company.
This data set provides information to help you predict what behavior will help you to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.

The dataset includes information about:

Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
Customer account information – how long they had been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
